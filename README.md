This dataset is all about smartphones, various features they possess, ratings and prices of each brand.

I carried out the following procedures to clean and analyze data within Excel -

1.  Duplicates were not found in the dataset.
2.  Filled the blank cells with constant 0.
3.  Separate brand names from model column using left and made new column namely brand names.
4.  Delete brand names in the model column.
5.  Hide columns.
6.  Colored blank columns filled with zero using conditional formatting.
7.  Trimmed spaces.
8.  Sort the data by brand names.
9.  Alloted currency to the price column.
10. Resolution column was messed up. I corrected it and replace with x.
11. Calculated average price and ratings and named it as Summary.
12. Made Pivot table and charts after data cleaning.
13. Plotted two bar graphs of an average price and rating.
